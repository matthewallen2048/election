                    <p>2048 Candidate Matthew Allen announced his endorsement of many Democrats running in his district, 
                    including Hillary Clinton (Presidential), Niki Tsongas (US Congress), Oscar Camargo (State Representative),
                    and Barbara L'Italien, for whom he works as an intern (State Senate), today in his hometown of Andover, 
                    Massachusetts. In his endorsement, he not only praised the work that these four candidates do for working 
                    families in America, but he laid bruising criticisms of their opponents. About the Presidential race, he said, 
                    "[y]ou have [Hillary Clinton], who has worked her whole life to help working families stay afloat, and you have 
                    [Donald Trump], who has working his whole life to cheat them out of money through shady business dealings. 
                    The choice seems extremely clear to me." After an early endorsement of Bernie Sanders in May of 2015, Allen's 
                    endorsement of Clinton was not only a show of support, but an effort to bring more "Bernie-or-Bust" folk into 
                    the Clinton camp. He had this to say about the US Congress race: "Niki Tsongas has done an excellent job these 
                    past 9 years as the 3rd district's Representative in Congress, and has worked especially hard to stop sexual 
                    assault in the military, working across party lines to do so. While she has done great work working with both 
                    parties, her opponent, Ann Wofford, would be yet another do nothing Republicans, following Paul Ryan blindly." 
                    About the State Representative race, he said, "[w]hile Jim Lyons has hurt working families here in Andover, 
                    Boxford, North Andover, and Tewksbury, Oscar Camargo has been an active member of our community, not only while 
                    serving for 16 years in the military, but as an activist for change. He has my support." And his final remarks were 
                    about the State Senate race. "My dear friend, Senator Barbara L'Italien, is someone who has gotten a whole lot done 
                    for the people of Andover, Dracut, Lawrence, and Tewksbury. She has worked to keep the Kinder-Morgan pipeline out 
                    of our district, brought funding back for schools and small businesses, and saved the pensions that town employees 
                    were promised. She has been a tireless advocate for the average working citizen, here in the 2nd Essex/Middlesex 
                    District, and I am proud to support her and work for her. Her opponent does not share these same values. Rather 
                    than advocating for working people, she advocates for big businesses. Rather the helping public schools, she wants 
                    to expand charter schools." To summate, he said this: "[w]e as voting citizens will have many choices this November. 
                    Let's all make the right ones, because we may never recover as a country, state, or district, if we make the wrong 
                    ones."</p>
